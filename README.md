# facebook-posts-to-reddit-bot
Old laravel app built for a client that wanted to scrape a list of facebook groups / pages & all of their posts, and then post them to a particular subreddit. 

Documentation is shit.

Code isn't organized the best.

But it does what it was made to do pretty well. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or need assistance in getting it setup.
